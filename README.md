# grpc_ros_adapter

## Introduction

This repo includes functionality for interfacing with Marus over gRPC and publish sensor data over ROS such that it is available to other ROS nodes.

Unity package is maintained in [marus-core](https://github.com/MARUSimulator/marus-core) repository.

Proto messages are maintained in [marus-proto](https://github.com/MARUSimulator/marus-proto) repository.

## Getting started
Recommended ROS distribution is Noetic.
 Setup:
* Clone this repository in your catkin workspace.
After cloning, run following command to pull latest proto generated source files:
`git submodule update --init`

* It is also recommended to create a `virtualenv` and then install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Clone [uuv_sensor_msgs](https://github.com/labust/uuv_sensor_msgs) in your workspace

* Build with `catkin build`

* If you encounter build errors, you can try building with python3:
`catkin build -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.7m`

* Start grpc server:
`roslaunch grpc_ros_adapter launch_server.launch`
